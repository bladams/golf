Code Golf Challenges
====================

My attempts to implement simple algorithms in Python with as few statements as possible.

# Conway's Game of Life #

See [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) for the rules. To try it:

    python life.py

To stop it press Ctrl+C. To change the size of the board, modify the value of the boardSize variable. To change the initial board configuration, assign your initial configuration to `board` as a list of rows which are each a list of booleans (e.g. `board = [[False, False, False],[True, True, True],[False, False, False]]`)
